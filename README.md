Weather Dashboard --- Homework 06

## About This Application
This is a simple app designed to allow users to quickly and easily find the current weather and 5-day forecast for a given location. The user's previous searches are stored in local storage for quick access to frequently searched locales.

## Libraries, Frameworks, and APIs

* ~~Bootstrap - Used for mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and basic page layout~~
* Foundation - Used for mobile responsiveness, accessibility, and page layout
    * Foundation is used over Bootstrap because components are more portable and it is easier to include only what's needed vs. a whole framework.
* JQuery - Used for DOM querying and dynamic content insertion
* Moment - Used for setting and manipulating dates
* OpenWeatherMap - Weather API used for current weather data and forecasts
